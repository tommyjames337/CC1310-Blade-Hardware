# CC1310-Blade-Hardware README

This repository contains the crucial design files for the CC1310 Blade (Rev D). Note that the Rev D board is functionally
identical to the Rev C board. It will work with all CC1310 Blade Rev C demo projects.

The files in this project should be organized accordingly in order to open the project correctly in KiCad:

Place CC1310_Dev_Board_D into desired directory.

Stock.zip and CC1310.zip should be unpacked into the same directory that CC1310_Dev_Board_D was placed into.


After the project is correctly opened, Gerber files may be created, and the PCBs may be ordered from your favorite manufacturer.
