# CC1310-Blade-Hardware README

This repository contains the crucial design files for the CC1310 Blade (Rev D). Note that the Rev D board is functionally
identical to the Rev C board. It will work with all CC1310 Blade Rev C demo projects.

The files in this project should be organized accordingly in order to open the project correctly in KiCad:

1) Place CC1310_Dev_Board_D into desired directory.

2) Stock.zip and CC1310.zip should be unpacked into the same directory that CC1310_Dev_Board_D was placed into.


After the project is correctly opened, you may have to correct the references to the footprint and schematic symbol files. Once these references are corrected, you may create gerber files and order PCBs from your favorite manufacturer.
